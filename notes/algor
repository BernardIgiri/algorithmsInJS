PDF: Update History, Latest version (8/1/2016)

The following are the common subjects in coding interviews. As understanding those concepts requires much more effort, this tutorial only serves as an introduction. The subjects that are covered include: 1) String/Array/Matrix, 2) Linked List, 3) Tree, 4) Heap, 5) Graph, 6) Sorting, 7) Dynamic Programming, 8) Bit Manipulation, 9) Combinations and Permutations, and 10) Math Problems. I highly recommend you to read "Simple Java" first, if you need a brief review of Java basics. If you want to see code examples that show how to use a popular API, you can use JavaSED.com.

1. String/Array

An algorithm problem's input is often a string or array. Without auto-completion of any IDE, the following methods should be remembered.

toCharArray() //get char array of a String
charAt(int x) //get a char at the specific index
length() //string length
length //array size 
substring(int beginIndex) 
substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)
Integer.valueOf()//string to integer
String.valueOf()/integer to string
Arrays.sort()  //sort an array
Arrays.toString(char[] a) //convert to string
Arrays.copyOf(T[] original, int newLength)
System.arraycopy(Object src, int srcPos, Object dest, int destPos, int length)

3. Linked List

The implementation of a linked list is pretty simple in Java. Each node has a value and a link to next node.

class Node {
	int val;
	Node next;
 
	Node(int x) {
		val = x;
		next = null;
	}
}
Two popular applications of linked list are stack and queue.

Stack

class Stack{
	Node top; 
 
	public Node peek(){
		if(top != null){
			return top;
		}
 
		return null;
	}
 
	public Node pop(){
		if(top == null){
			return null;
		}else{
			Node temp = new Node(top.val);
			top = top.next;
			return temp;	
		}
	}
 
	public void push(Node n){
		if(n != null){
			n.next = top;
			top = n;
		}
	}
}
Queue

class Queue{
	Node first, last;
 
	public void enqueue(Node n){
		if(first == null){
			first = n;
			last = first;
		}else{
			last.next = n;
			last = n;
		}
	}
 
	public Node dequeue(){
		if(first == null){
			return null;
		}else{
			Node temp = new Node(first.val);
			first = first.next;
			return temp;
		}	
	}
}
The Java standard library contains a class called "Stack". Another class from Java SDK is LinkedList, which can be used as a Queue (add() and remove()). (LinkedList implements the Queue interface.) If a stack or queue is required to solve problems during your interview, they are ready to be used.

17) Implement a Queue using an Array
18) Delete Node in a Linked List
19) Reverse Nodes in k-Group

4. Tree, Heap and Trie

A tree normally refers to a binary tree. Each node contains a left node and right node like the following:

class TreeNode{
	int value;
	TreeNode left;
	TreeNode right;
}
Here are some concepts related with trees:

Binary Search Tree: for all nodes, left children <= current node <= right children
Balanced vs. Unbalanced: In a balanced tree, the depth of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by 1 or less.
Full Binary Tree: every node other than the leaves has two children.
Perfect Binary Tree: a full binary tree in which all leaves are at the same depth or same level, and in which every parent has two children.
Complete Binary Tree: a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible
Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. The time complexity of its operations are important (e.g., find-min, delete-min, insert, etc). In Java, PriorityQueue is important to know.

5. Graph

Graph related questions mainly focus on depth first search and breath first search. Depth first search is straightforward, you can just loop through neighbors starting from the root node.

Below is a simple implementation of a graph and breath first search. The key is using a queue to store nodes.

breath-first-search

1) Define a GraphNode

class GraphNode{ 
	int val;
	GraphNode next;
	GraphNode[] neighbors;
	boolean visited;
 
	GraphNode(int x) {
		val = x;
	}
 
	GraphNode(int x, GraphNode[] n){
		val = x;
		neighbors = n;
	}
 
	public String toString(){
		return "value: "+ this.val; 
	}
}
2) Define a Queue

class Queue{
	GraphNode first, last;
 
	public void enqueue(GraphNode n){
		if(first == null){
			first = n;
			last = first;
		}else{
			last.next = n;
			last = n;
		}
	}
 
	public GraphNode dequeue(){
		if(first == null){
			return null;
		}else{
			GraphNode temp = new GraphNode(first.val, first.neighbors);
			first = first.next;
			return temp;
		}	
	}
}
3) Breath First Search uses a Queue

public class GraphTest {
 
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		GraphNode n1 = new GraphNode(1); 
		GraphNode n2 = new GraphNode(2); 
		GraphNode n3 = new GraphNode(3); 
		GraphNode n4 = new GraphNode(4); 
		GraphNode n5 = new GraphNode(5); 
 
		n1.neighbors = new GraphNode[]{n2,n3,n5};
		n2.neighbors = new GraphNode[]{n1,n4};
		n3.neighbors = new GraphNode[]{n1,n4,n5};
		n4.neighbors = new GraphNode[]{n2,n3,n5};
		n5.neighbors = new GraphNode[]{n1,n3,n4};
 
		breathFirstSearch(n1, 5);
	}
 
	public static void breathFirstSearch(GraphNode root, int x){
		if(root.val == x)
			System.out.println("find in root");
 
		Queue queue = new Queue();
		root.visited = true;
		queue.enqueue(root);
 
		while(queue.first != null){
			GraphNode c = (GraphNode) queue.dequeue();
			for(GraphNode n: c.neighbors){
 
				if(!n.visited){
					System.out.print(n + " ");
					n.visited = true;
					if(n.val == x)
						System.out.println("Find "+n);
					queue.enqueue(n);
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
Output:

value: 2 value: 3 value: 5 Find value: 5
value: 4
Classic Problems:
1) Clone Graph
2) Course Schedule , Course Schedule II , Minimum Height Trees
3) Reconstruct Itinerary
4) Graph Valid Tree

6. Sorting

Time complexity of different sorting algorithms. You can go to wiki to see basic idea of them.

Algorithm	Average Time	Worst Time	Space
Bubble sort	n^2	n^2	1
Selection sort	n^2	n^2	1
Insertion sort	n^2	n^2	
Quick sort	n log(n)	n^2	
Merge sort	n log(n)	n log(n)	depends
* BinSort, Radix Sort and CountSort use different set of assumptions than the rest, and so they are not "general" sorting methods. (Thanks to Fidel for pointing this out)

Here are some implementations/demos, and in addition, you may want to check out how Java developers sort in practice.
1) Mergesort
2) Quicksort
3) InsertionSort.
4) Maximum Gap (Bucket Sort)
5) Sort Colors (Counting Sort)

7. Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems with the following properties:

An instance is solved using the solutions for smaller instances.
The solution for a smaller instance might be needed multiple times.
The solutions to smaller instances are stored in a table, so that each smaller instance is solved only once.
Additional space is used to save time.

The problem of climbing steps perfectly fit those 4 properties. Therefore, it can be solve by using dynamic programming.

public static int[] A = new int[100];
 
public static int f3(int n) {
	if (n <= 2)
		A[n]= n;
 
	if(A[n] > 0)
		return A[n];
	else
		A[n] = f3(n-1) + f3(n-2);//store results so only calculate once!
	return A[n];
}
Classic problems:
1) Edit Distance
1) Distinct Subsequences Total
2) Longest Palindromic Substring

8. Bit Manipulation

Bit operators:

OR (|)	AND (&)	XOR (^)	Left Shift (<<)	Right Shift (>>)	Not (~)
1|0=1	1&0=0	1^0=1	0010<<2=1000	1100>>2=0011	~1=0
Get bit i for a give number n. (i count from 0 and starts from right)

public static boolean getBit(int num, int i){
	int result = num & (1<<i);
 
	if(result == 0){
		return false;
	}else{
		return true;
	}
}
For example, get second bit of number 10.

i=1, n=10
1<<1= 10 1010&10=10 10 is not 0, so return true;
Classic Problems:
1) Single Number
1) Single Number II
2) Maximum Binary Gap
3) Number of 1 Bits 
4) Reverse Bits 
5) Repeated DNA Sequences
6) Bitwise AND of Numbers Range 
7) Sum of Two Integers
8) Counting Bits
9) Maximum Product of Word Lengths
10) Gray Code

9. Combinations and Permutations

The difference between combination and permutation is whether order matters.

Example 1:

Given 5 numbers - 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, print out different sequence of the 5 numbers. 4 can not be the third one, 3 and 5 can not be adjacent. How many different combinations?

Example 2:

Given 5 banaba, 4 pear, and 3 apple, assuming one kind of fruit are the same, how many different combinations?

1) Reverse Integer
2) Palindrome Number
3) Pow(x,n), Power of Two, Power of Three, Power of Four
